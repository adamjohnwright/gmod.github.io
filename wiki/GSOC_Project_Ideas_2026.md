*Got an idea for [GSOC 2026](GSoC "GSoC")?'*

Then please post it. You can either

1.  Add it here, by directly editing this page. Just copy, paste and
    update the [template](#Template) below. This requires that you create
    a fork of this repo and then make a pull request with the changes.

Projects can use a broad set of skills, technologies, and domains, such
as GUIs, database integration and algorithms.

Students are also encouraged to propose their own ideas related to our
projects. If you have strong computer skills and have an interest in
biology or bioinformatics, you should definitely apply! Do not hesitate
to propose your own project idea: some of the best applications we see
are by students who go this route. As long as it is relevant to one of
our projects, we will give it serious consideration. Creativity and
self-motivation are great traits for open-source programmers.

## <span id="MP-BioPath_Perturation_Analysis_.2F_Stein_Lab" class="mw-headline">MP-BioPath Perturation Analysis / Stein Lab</span>

- *Brief explanation:* MP-BioPath is a computational tool designed to
  predict the effects of perturbations on biological pathways. Utilizing
  Reactome's pathway models, MP-BioPath employs an optimization model.
  Our objective is to develop pipelines and tools that integrate
  MP-BioPath results with genomic data.
- *Expected results:* As a result of this project, we aim to develop
  tools and pipelines capable of handling diverse genomic datasets.
  Additionally, we anticipate the generation of novel biologically
  significant insights.

## <span id="Pathway_Reasoning_with_LLM_.2F_Stein_Lab" class="mw-headline">Pathway Reasoning with LLM / Stein Lab</span>

- *Brief explanation:* Reactome houses a meticulously curated repository
  of human biological pathways. Our current initiative focuses on
  crafting a RAG chat application optimized for intuitive interaction
  with the Reactome web portal. Our primary aim is to empower the
  application to interpret user queries and leverage the LLM (Language
  Model) to delve deep into pathway structures, enabling the generation
  of comprehensive and insightful responses for users.
- *Expected results:* expected outcomes include the application's
  ability to effectively handle a diverse range of user queries and to
  expand its capabilities to accommodate an increased number of use
  cases. Furthermore, the application is expected to leverage advanced
  reasoning capabilities powered by the LLM, thereby providing more
  insightful and comprehensive responses tailored to each user's inquiry

## <span id="Reactome-MCP_.2F_Stein_Lab" class="mw-headline">Reactome MCP / Stein Lab</span>

- *Brief explanation:* Reactome provides users with various computational
  interfaces for computationally accessing the curated biological pathways,
  including analysis tools and a chat interface React-to-Me. A Reactome MCP would
  make the website more computationally accessible by providing access to the tools
  through React-to-Me and other LLM based chat interfaces. 
- *Expected results:* expected outcomes include the application's
  ability to run Reactome analysis tools through the React-to-Me chat interface.
  Other features of Reactome, including our REST APIs, should be made accessible
  to LLMs through the MCP.

## <span id="AI_Social_Media_Project" class="mw-headline">Development and Validation of an AI System for Real-Time Detection of Pediatric ENT Health Trends on Social Media (Pediatric Otolaryngology Lab / AI in Digital Health) / Courtot Lab</span>

- *Brief explanation:* This project will develop and validate a real-time artificial intelligence (AI) application that continuously monitors major social media platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, X, and Reddit) to identify emerging health-related trends involving ear, nose, and throat (ENT) issues among children and adolescents. The system will classify and rank viral behaviors based on engagement metrics and notify pediatric otolaryngologists about potentially harmful trends or misinformation. The goal is to explore how automated social media surveillance can support early awareness and clinical decision-making in pediatric otolaryngology. 
- *Expected results:* expected outcomes include:
    - A working prototype of a real-time social media monitoring pipeline.
    - Automated collection of public data via platform APIs.
    - NLP/LLM-based classification and ranking of pediatric ENT-related trends.
    - A reporting dashboard visualizing trends, engagement metrics, and risk flags for clinicians.
Evaluation of model performance (precision, recall, accuracy) and preliminary assessment of clinical usefulness with pediatric otolaryngologists.
Documentation and open-source code suitable for further research and extension. 
- *Project Home Page URL:*

- *Knowledge prerequisites:* Programming languages: Python (for AI/NLP and data pipelines), JavaScript/TypeScript (for frontend)
Experience with:
    - REST APIs and social media data extraction
    - NLP and/or LLM integration

## <span id="AI_Reactome_Visualization_Interface" class="mw-headline">Improving Reactome Pathway Analysis with an Interactive Visualization and AI Explanation Layer (Reactome / Stein Lab)</span>

- *Brief explanation:* Reactome provides pathway analysis tools through its web interface and REST APIs, but interpreting the results (pathways, p-values, associated gene sets) can be challenging for students and non-expert users. This project proposes building a user-friendly web interface on top of Reactome’s existing analysis APIs where users can upload a gene list (e.g., from RNA-seq differential expression output), run pathway analysis, and explore the results through interactive visualizations. An AI-based explanation layer will summarize enriched pathways in plain language to improve accessibility and interpretation. The project will focus on usability and integration rather than reimplementing statistical enrichment methods.

- *Expected results:*
    - Upload interface for gene list files (CSV/TSV)
    - Backend integration with Reactome pathway analysis REST API
    - Interactive dashboard to explore enriched pathways (sorting, filtering, viewing p-values and associated genes)
    - Network-style visualization of pathway relationships
    - AI-generated summaries explaining enriched pathways in natural language
    - Option to export a summary report

- *Project Home Page URL:*
  <a href="https://reactome.org" class="external text"
  rel="nofollow">Reactome</a>

- *Project paper reference and URL:* None specific; this project focuses on improving usability and interpretability of existing Reactome analysis tools.

- *Knowledge prerequisites:* Python (backend/API integration), React + TypeScript (frontend development), REST APIs, basic understanding of pathway enrichment, familiarity with LLM integration.

- *Skill level:* Medium

- *Project Time:* 175-hour approximately 10 weeks

- *Mentors:* Lincoln Stein <lincoln.stein@gmail.com>
