**<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Google Summer of Code</a>** is a global program that
offers students, developers, and other contributors stipends to write
code for various open-source software projects. We work with many
open-source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify
and fund projects over a 12+ week period. Since its inception, twenty-one
years ago, the program brought together over 22,000 successful
participants from 123 countries, 1200+ open-source organizations, and has
generated over 48 million lines of code. Through Google Summer of Code,
accepted applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the
participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software
development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas
related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects
can more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of
all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of
all. The program is open to students and to beginners in open source
software development. The length of the projects is 90, 175, and
350-hours, and there is an option to extend the program from the
standard 12 weeks up to 22 weeks. (*Excerpt from the

Since 2011, the Open Genome Informatics group has served as an "umbrella
organization" to a variety of bioinformatics projects, including
[GMOD](Main_Page "Main Page") and its software projects --
[JBrowse](JBrowse.1 "JBrowse"), [Apollo](Apollo.1 "Apollo"),
<a href="Chado" class="mw-redirect" title="Chado">Chado</a>,
[Galaxy](Galaxy.1 "Galaxy") etc.;

- Discussion mailing lists:
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/genome-informatics"
  class="external text" rel="nofollow">Genome Informatics Google
  Groups</a> - ask about our projects; join the community!
- Students and Mentors can email both
  [Robin](rhaw@oicr.on.ca) and
  [Adam](awright@oicr.on.ca) to get more information about the
  program.

## <span id="Project_Ideas" class="mw-headline"> [Project Ideas](GSOC_Project_Ideas_2026 "GSOC Project Ideas 2026")</span>

**Got an idea for a GSOC project? [Add it
here](GSOC_Project_Ideas_2026 "GSOC Project Ideas 2026").** Ideas will
be included in the proposal we send to GSOC, and great ideas make for a
great proposal, so please add yours now.

These projects can use a broad set of skills, technologies, and domains,
such as GUIs, database integration, and algorithms. Students are also
encouraged to propose their own ideas related to our projects. If you
have strong computer skills and have an interest in biology or
bioinformatics, you should definitely apply!  
**Do not hesitate to propose your own project idea: some of the best
applications we see are by students who go this route.** As long as it
is relevant to one of our projects, we will give it serious
consideration. Creativity and self-motivation are great traits for
open-source programmers.

## <span id="Preparing_for_GSoC_2026" class="mw-headline">Preparing for GSoC 2026</span>

Right now, it is the organization application process for GSoC - we won't
know if Open Genome Informatics has been accepted as a GSOC 2026
mentoring organization until
<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">February 22nd</a>. Nevertheless, it
is a perfect time if students would like to talk to mentors about
project ideas. If you are interested in mentoring, please check the
Mentors section below, and contact the organization admin.

### <span id="Contributors" class="mw-headline">Contributors</span>

More information about [writing your
application](GSOC_Applications_Guide "GSOC Applications Guide") will be
available closer to the start of the student application period.

### <span id="Mentors" class="mw-headline">Mentors</span>

We encourage mentors and mentoring organizations to think about new
projects year-round! If you'd like help with your ideas page or your
separate mentoring org application, please feel free to contact the
organization admins. Links to [advice about mentoring and other
resources](GSOC_Mentoring_Guide "GSOC Mentoring Guide") are available.

### <span id="Source_Code" class="mw-headline">Source Code</span>

Genome and bioinformatics projects that participate in the Open Genome
Informatics group maintain there own [source code
repositories](Source_Code_Repositories "Source Code Repositories").
